**Timing the Core Equity Factor**

We apply PCA to the monthly returns of the constituents of the CAC40 in order to construct the Core Equity factor. 
We then build a simple long-only strategy using a local linear trend model on the replication portfolio we previously constructed, and assess whether or not the performance of this strategy is due to luck using a bootstrapping technique.
